# OctCoder Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OctCoder!

To clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, SimWorks ("we" or "us") must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of the project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

By submitting a contribution (e.g., via a pull request) to this project, you (or your employer) are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this CLA.

## Agreement

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future contributions submitted to the OctCoder project. Except for the license granted herein to SimWorks and recipients of software distributed by SimWorks, you reserve all right, title, and interest in and to your contributions.

**1. Grant of Copyright License.** You hereby grant to SimWorks and to recipients of software distributed by SimWorks a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your contributions and such derivative works.

**2. Grant of Patent License.** You hereby grant to SimWorks and to recipients of software distributed by SimWorks a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your contribution(s) alone or by combination of your contribution(s) with the work to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against you or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your contribution, or the work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that contribution shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

**3. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license.** If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your contributions to SimWorks, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with SimWorks.

**4. You represent that each of your contributions is your own original work.** You represent that your contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of your contributions.

**5. You are not expected to provide support for your contributions,** except to the extent you desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, you provide your contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
